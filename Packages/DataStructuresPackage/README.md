# DataStructuresPackage

The DataStructuresPackage is a Swift package dedicated to providing efficient and versatile data structures 
tailored for Swift applications. It focuses on enhancing data handling capabilities with structures like 
doubly linked lists and queues, ensuring both flexibility and performance in data management tasks.

## Features

	•	Generic Implementation: Works with any data type that conforms to the Equatable protocol.
	•	Efficient Operations: Includes operations for adding, 
		removing, and accessing elements from both ends of the list.
	•	Versatile Use Cases: Ideal for scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion operations are required.

### Queue

	•	FIFO Principle: Adheres to the First-In-First-Out methodology for managing elements.
	•	Doubly Linked List Backed: Utilizes the DoublyLinkedList structure for efficient element handling.
	•	Essential Operations: Supports enqueue (add to end) and dequeue (remove from front) operations along with 
		peeking at the front element.
